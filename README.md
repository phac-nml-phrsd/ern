This repository stores the code used in `ern`, an R package to estimate
the effective reproduction number ($R_t$) of pathogens using clinical or
wastewater data.

This package is developed at the Public Health Agency of Canada /
National Microbiology Laboratory. Please note this software is provivded
“as is”, without warranty of any kind; see the [license](LICENSE).

## Installation

To install the latest version of this package:

``` r
devtools::install_github('phac-nml-phrsd/ern')
```

### Note on JAGS

`rjags` is a dependency for `ern`, specifically for Rt calculations
performed on clinical testing data using the "renewal" method for inference of the daily incidence from aggregated clinical data. 
If you are only using the "linear" method, or performing
calculations using wastewater data, you do not need to worry about
installing `rjags` and can skip this section.

`rjags` is the R interface for the [`JAGS` Bayesian modelling
library](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/). Installation of `JAGS` is
required and the latest version can be found
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/). It is
recommended that you are using the latest version of R and `JAGS` for
optimal usage of `ern`.

- For users who are only unable to install the latest version of `JAGS`,
  we recommend downgrading to an R version that is less than 4.2. More
  details can be found
  [here](https://martynplummer.wordpress.com/2022/04/12/windows-update-jags-4-3-1-is-released/)
- For users who are having issues installing or running `JAGS` or
  `rjags`, we recommend consulting the [`JAGS` discussion
  board](https://sourceforge.net/p/mcmc-jags/discussion/610037/).
